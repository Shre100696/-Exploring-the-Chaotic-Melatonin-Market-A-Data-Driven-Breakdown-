### **🧪 Exploring the Chaotic Melatonin Market: A Data-Driven Breakdown! 📊**  

The market for **melatonin products** is highly unregulated, with doses ranging from **1mg to 25mg+** and products marketed to both **adults and children**. 🌙💤  

🔍 **Key Questions We're Exploring:**  
1️⃣ **How are melatonin products distributed across different doses?**  
2️⃣ **Are there significant differences between adult and children's formulations?**  
3️⃣ **What is the most common dose, and does it align with recommended sleep aid guidelines?**  

💡 **How We're Analyzing the Data:**  
✅ Using **pandas** & **NumPy** to structure and manipulate the dataset  
✅ Conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns  
✅ **Visualizing dose distribution** across products using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
✅ Categorizing by **age group & dosage strength** for meaningful insights  

📌 **Preliminary Insights (Expected):**  
- Are high-dose melatonin products more common than lower doses?  
- Do **children's formulations** contain lower doses, or are some unexpectedly high?  
- Is there a **standardized "recommended dose"**, or does it vary wildly?  

🔬 This project isn't just about numbers—it's about understanding how **consumer choices** and **marketing strategies** shape the supplement industry.
